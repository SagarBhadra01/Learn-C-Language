#include <assert.h>	 //It contains information for adding diagnostics that aid program debugging.
#include <errno.h>	 //It is used to perform error handling operations like errno(), strerror(), perror(), etc.
#include <float.h>	 //It contains a set of various platform-dependent constants related to floating point values. These constants are proposed by ANSI C.They make programs more portable. Some examples of constants included in this header file are- e(exponent), b(base/radix), etc.
#include <math.h>	 //It is used to perform mathematical operations like sqrt(), log2(), pow(), etc.
#include <signal.h>	 //It is used to perform signal handling functions like signal() and raise().
#include <stdarg.h>	 //It is used to perform standard argument functions like va_start() and va_arg(). It is also used to indicate start of thevariable-length argument list and to fetch the arguments from the variable-length argument list in the program respectively.
#include <conio.h>   
#include <ctype.h>	 //It contains function prototypes for functions that test characters for certain properties, and also function prototypes for functions that can be used to convert uppercase letters to lowercase letters and vice versa.
#include <stdio.h>	 //It is used to perform input and output operations using functions like scanf(), printf(), etc.
#include <string.h>	 //It is used to perform various functionalities related to string manipulation like strlen(), strcmp(), strcpy(), size(), etc.
#include <limits.h>	 //It determines the various properties of the various variable types. The macros defined in this header limits the values of various variable types like char, int, and long. These limits specify that a variable cannot store any value beyond these limits, for example, an unsigned character can store up to a maximum value of 255.
#include <time.h>	 //It is used to perform functions related to date() and time() like setdate() and getdate(). It is also used to modify the system date and get the CPU time respectively.
#include <stddef.h>	 //It contains common type definitions used by C for performing calculations.
#include <locale.h>	 //It contains function prototypes and other information that enables a program to be modified for the current locale on which itâ€™s running. It enables the computer system to handle different conventions for expressing data such as times, dates, or large numbers throughout the world.
