// continue:	Continues to the next iteration of a loop
// default:	Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
// do:	Used together with while to create a do/while loop
// double:	A data type that is usually 64 bits long which can store fractional numbers

// for:	Creates a for loop
// goto:	Jumps to a line of code specified by a label
// if:	Makes a conditional statement
// int:	A data type that is usually 32 bits long which can store whole numbers
// long:	Ensures that an integer is at least 32 bits long (use long long to ensure 64 bits)
// return:	Used to return a value from a function
// register:
// short:	Reduces the size of an integer to 16 bits
// signed:	Specifies that an int or char can represent both positive and negative values (for int this is the default so the keyword is not usually necessary)

// static:	Specifies that a variable in a function keeps its value after the function ends
// struct:	Defines a structure
// switch:	Selects one of many code blocks to be executed
// typedef:	Defines a custom data type
// union:
// unsigned:	Specifies that an int or char should only represent positive values which allows for storing numbers up to twice as large
